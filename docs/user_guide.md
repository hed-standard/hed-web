## Getting started

### Accessing HED online tools

HED web-based tools are available directly through a browser at [https://hedtools.org/hed](https://hedtools.org/hed). These tools are free to use and don't require a login. Two versions are available:

- **Production**: [https://hedtools.org/hed](https://hedtools.org/hed) - Stable release version
- **Development**: [https://hedtools.org/hed_dev](https://hedtools.org/hed_dev) - Latest development features

### Tool organization

The HED browser-based tools are organized into the following pages:

| Tool             | URL                                           | Description                                                                 |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Events**       | [link](https://hedtools.org/hed/events)       | Validation, summary, search, and generation tools for tabular (.tsv) files  |
| **Sidecars**     | [link](https://hedtools.org/hed/sidecars)     | Validation, transformation, extraction, and merging tools for JSON sidecars |
| **Spreadsheets** | [link](https://hedtools.org/hed/spreadsheets) | Validation and transformation tools for spreadsheet files                   |
| **Strings**      | [link](https://hedtools.org/hed/strings)      | Quick validation and transformation of individual HED strings               |
| **Schemas**      | [link](https://hedtools.org/hed/schemas)      | Validation, conversion, and comparison tools for HED schemas                |

### Common features

#### Schema selection

Most tools require you to specify a HED schema version. You can:

- **Select a standard version**: Use the pull-down menu to choose from official HED releases
- **Upload a custom schema**: Select "Other" and upload your own HED schema file

The tool automatically caches standard schemas for faster processing.

#### Tag formats

HED supports three tag formats:

- **Short form**: Only the leaf node (e.g., `Red`)
- **Long form**: Full path from root (e.g., `Property/Sensory-property/.../Red`)
- **Intermediate form**: Partial path (e.g., `Color/Red`)

All HED tools handle any combination of these formats. The short form is recommended for annotation.

#### Definition expansion

Many tools have an `Expand defs` option that replaces `Def/xxx` tags with expanded definitions in the form `(Def-expand/xxx, yyy)` where `yyy` is the actual definition content.

#### Tabular formats
Tabular files are BIDS-style tab-separated value (.tsv) files with a header line giving column names. These columns map to metadata in accompanying JSON sidecars. HED handles two types of tabular files -- files that have an `onset` column (timeline files) and those that don't (descriptive files). The BIDS `_events.tsv` files are the most common timeline files. An example of a descriptive file is the BIDS `participants.tsv` file. 

#### Limiting errors

Most of the validation actions have an option to limit the errors. Checking this option results in the error report only reporting two of each type of error. This is useful because often the same error is repeated for each error of the tabular file and fixing it once (usually a sidecar problem), fixes them all. Once you correct all the errors with the limit errors on and the check for warnings off, you should try again with the limit errors off and the check for warnings on to make sure that you have understood and corrected all issues.

## Working with tabular files

Events files are BIDS-style tab-separated value (`.tsv`) files with a header line giving column names. These columns map to metadata in accompanying JSON sidecars.

### Validate an events file

Validates HED annotations in a BIDS events file or other tabular file. An excellent annotation strategy is to focus on debugging a single annotation file supported by a JSON sidecar located at the highest possible level. For `_events.tsv`, a JSON sidecar at the top level of a BIDS dataset applies to all `_events.tsv` files in the dataset -- so debugging one file and its sidecar essentially debugs them all.

**Steps:**

1. Select the `Validate` action
2. Enable `Check for warnings` if you want to include warnings (don't on the first pass)
3. Enable `Limit errors reported` so that at most 2 of each type of error appear in output (only at first)
4. Upload a tabular file (`.tsv`)
5. Optionally upload a JSON sidecar file (`.json`)
6. Select the HED version
7. Click the `Process` button

**Returns:** A downloadable `.txt` file of error messages if errors are found.

**Note:** This tool validates a single tabular file. For full BIDS dataset validation with inherited sidecars and library schemas, use the [JavaScript HEDTools](https://www.hedtags.org/hed-javascript) which has a browser-based validator that works on the entire dataset.  However, from a practical viewpoint, it is better to debug a single file first.

### Check HED quality

Evaluates the HED annotations in a BIDS events file or other tabular file for correct semantic usage. 

**Steps:**

1. Select the `Check HED quality` action
2. Disable `Show detailed errors` (only at first to get a sense of the quality complaints)
3. Enable `Limit errors reported` so that at most 2 of each type of error appear in output (only at first)
4. Upload a tabular file (`.tsv`)
5. Optionally upload a JSON sidecar file (`.json`)
6. Select the HED version
7. Click the `Process` button

**Returns:** A downloadable `.txt` file of quality messages if errors are found.

### Assemble HED annotations

Produces a file with fully assembled HED annotations for each event, combining sidecar and column values.

**Steps:**

1. Select the `Assemble HED annotations` action
2. Enable `Append assembled` if you want a HEDAssembled column added to the tabular file.
3. Enable `Include context` if you want the `Event-context group with ongoing events included
4. Enable `Replace defs` if you to replace the definitions with their contents
5. Enable `Remove condition and task` if you want condition variables and task groups removed.
6. Upload a tabular file (`.tsv`)
7. Optionally upload a JSON sidecar file (`.json`)
8. Select the HED version
9. Click the `Process` button

**Returns:** A downloadable `.tsv` file with two columns: onset times and assembled HED strings (unless the `Append assembled` option is selected).

### Search HED

Search for events matching specific HED criteria within an events file.

**Steps:**

1. Select the `Search HED` action
2. Enable `Append assembled` if you want a HEDAssembled column added to the tabular file.
3. Enable `Include context` if you want the `Event-context group with ongoing events included
4. Enable `Replace defs` if you to replace the definitions with their contents
5. Enable `Remove condition and task` if you want condition variables and task groups removed.
6. Upload a tabular file (`.tsv`)
7. Optionally upload a JSON sidecar file (`.json`)
8. Enter the search query
9. Select the HED version
10. Click the `Process` button

**Returns:** A downloadable `.tsv` file containing only the rows matching your search criteria.

### Generate sidecar template

Creates a JSON sidecar template from tabular file, ready to be filled with HED annotations.

**Steps:**

1. Select the `Generate JSON sidecar template` action
2. Upload a tabular file (`.tsv`)
3. Review the column list that appears
4. In the left checkboxes, select columns to include in the template
5. In the right checkboxes, select columns requiring annotations for each individual unique column value
6. Click the `Process` button

**Returns:** A downloadable `.json` sidecar template file.

**Tip:** This action generates a template for an individual tabular file. This is sufficient for most datasets, provided their tabular files are similarly structured. The Python HEDTools [`hedpy extract-sidecar`](https://www.hedtags.org/hed-python/user_guide.html#available-commands) command line tool and the [`extract_json_template.ipynb`](https://github.com/hed-standard/hed-python/blob/main/examples/extract_json_template.ipynb) Jupyter notebook for generating a consolidated template from all of the tabular files of a particular type.

### Execute remodel script

Apply table remodeling operations to transform or summarize events files without programming.

**Steps:**

1. Select the `Execute remodel script` action
2. Enable `Include summaries` if you want summary output
3. Upload a tabular file (`.tsv`)
4. Optionally upload a JSON sidecar file (`.json`)
5. Upload the remodel instructions file (`.json`)
6. Select the HED version
7. Click the `Process` button

**Returns:** A zip archive containing transformed tabular and summaries.

**Tip:** The remodel instructions file contains a series of commands in JSON format that are designed to be run to transform and summarize every designated tabular file in a dataset (e.g., all of the `_events.tsv` files). The online tools only run the remodeling on a single tabular file. This is very useful for validating the instruction file and assuring the transformations are what is desired.

See the [Table remodeler documentation](https://www.hedtags.org/table-remodeler) for details on creating remodel scripts.

## Working with sidecars

BIDS JSON sidecars (files ending in `xxx.json`) contain metadata and HED annotations for the designated files (ending in `xxx.tsv`). See the BIDS [**Inheritance Principle**](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/common-principles.html#the-inheritance-principle) for a description of how the association is made. A convenient aspect of BIDS inheritance is that users can annotate all of the files of a single type (say `_events.tsv`) by placing a single (`_events.json`) file with the annotations at the top level of the BIDS dataset directory tree.

### Validate a sidecar

## Using RESTful services

HED provides REST API services for programmatic access to all tools.

### Service setup

1. Send HTTP `GET` request to obtain CSRF token: `https://hedtools.org/hed/services`
2. Extract CSRF token and cookie from response
3. Send HTTP `POST` requests with token to: `https://hedtools.org/hed/services_submit`

See the  [web services demos](https://github.com/hed-standard/hed-matlab/tree/main/hedmat/web_services_demos) in the MATLAB HEDTools for implementation examples.

### Request format

All requests are JSON dictionaries with a `service` parameter and additional parameters.

**Example:** Validating a JSON sidecar:

```json
{
    "service": "sidecar_validate",
    "schema_version": "8.4.0", 
    "json_string": "json file text",
    "check_for_warnings": "on"
}
```

        "command_target": "data_type",
        "data": "result_or_errors",
        "schema_version": "8.4.0",
        "msg_category": "success|warning|failure",
        "msg": "explanation"
    },
    "error_type": "",
    "error_msg": ""
}
```

- Empty `error_type` and `error_msg`: Operation completed otherwise indication of server failure
- `msg_category`: Indicates validation result (success/warning/failure)
- `data`: Contains processed result or validation errors

## Best practices

### For annotation development

1. **Start with templates**: Generate sidecar templates from events or other tabular files
2. **Use spreadsheet workflow**: Extract to spreadsheet, annotate, merge back
3. **Validate frequently**: Check annotations after each change
4. **Test with warnings**: Enable warning checks to catch potential issues after eliminating errors
5. **Always use short form**: Shorter tags are easier to read and maintain

### For schema development

1. **Validate before converting**: Always validate schemas before format conversion
2. **Use MEDIAWIKI for editing**: Easier to read and modify than other formats
3. **Compare versions**: Use comparison tool to track changes between versions
4. **Check warnings**: Schema warnings can indicate potential issues

### For programmatic access

1. **Cache CSRF tokens**: Reuse tokens across multiple requests in a session
2. **Handle errors gracefully**: Check both service errors and validation results
3. **Use specific versions**: Always specify schema versions (ideally the latest) for reproducibility

## Troubleshooting

### Common validation errors

**"Invalid HED tag"**

- Tag not found in specified schema version
- Check for typos in tag names
- Verify you're using the correct schema version

**"Comma and parentheses errors"**

- Missing or extra commas in HED string
- Tags in a group must be comma-separated
- Groups must be comma-separated
- Parentheses must match

**"Placeholder errors"**

- Placeholder can only be used in sidecars and definitions
- Only one placeholder per string

### File format issues

**"Cannot parse file"**

- Ensure TSV files use tabs, not spaces or commas
- Check for proper UTF-8 encoding
- Verify JSON files are valid JSON

**"Column not found"**

- A sidecar can have annotations for columns that are not in the .`tsv`
- A `.tsv` file that has a column not deliberately skipped and is not defined in the sidecar generates a warning
- Column names are case-sensitive

### Schema issues

**"Cannot load schema"**

- Check internet connection for downloading standard schemas
- For custom schemas, verify XML/mediawiki format
- Ensure schema file is complete and well-formed

### Service issues

**"CSRF token error"**

- Obtain fresh token from services endpoint
- Include token in request headers
- Check that cookie is preserved across requests

**"Service timeout"**

- Large files may timeout on web interface
- Consider using Python HEDTools for large datasets ir the JavaScript HEDTools for browser-based validation
- Break operations into smaller batches
