## What is HED?

HED (Hierarchical Event Descriptors) is a framework for systematically describing both laboratory and real-world events. HED tags are comma-separated path strings. The goal of HED is to describe precisely the nature of the events of interest occurring in an experiment using a common structured vocabulary and standardized tools. The HED framework has been developed for neurological imaging data (e.g., EEG, MEG, iEEG, fMRI), physiological (e.g., ECG, EMG, GSR) as well as multimodal experiment (e.g., mobile brain/body imaging). HED has been adopted as part of the BIDS ([**https://bids.neuroimaging.io**](https://bids.neuroimaging.io)) standard for brain imaging and accepted as a standard by the INCF ([**https://www.incf.org**](https://www.incf.org)).

## HED online tools

The HED online tools are a set of web-based applications for validating and analyzing Hierarchical Event Descriptors (HED) annotations. These tools rely on are designed to be used in a web browser and can be deployed locally or from a Docker container.

**Events files** are tabular (tab-separated) files. The first row of an events file contains column names. Each subsequent row corresponds to an event marker at a specified time in the corresponding data file.

**Note:** The operations listed for events file apply to any tabular (tab-separated value) file with column names.

**Sidecars** are JSON text files containing metadata. Sidecars follow the requirements of the [BIDS (Brain Imaging Data Structure)](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) standard.

**Spreadsheets** contain tabular data in either as an Excel (`.xlsx`) or as a tab-separated (`.tsv`) text file. They are used for convenience in assigning HED tags to event codes.

**Strings** refer to HED annotations, which are entered as strings for quick checks for validity or conversion.

**Schemas** refer to HED schema vocabularies, which may be either in .mediawiki or .xml format. These tools are used by schema developers creating the HED vocabularies and are not of interest to annotators or analysts.

More detailed help on using these online tools is available in the HED online tools [**User guide**](https://www.hedtags.org/hed-web/user_guide.html#).

#### HED REST services

The HED online tools are also available as callable web services. More detailed help on calling these services is available at: [**HED RESTful services**](https://www.hedtags.org/hed-web/user_guide.html#using-restful-services) Downloadable examples of calling these services from a MATLAB program can be found in the GitHub MATLAB [**Web service demos**](https://github.com/hed-standard/hed-matlab/tree/main/hedmat/web_services_demos).

#### Where to find out more?

- The [**HED home page**](https://www.hedtags.org) has links to all things HED.
- The [**HED GitHub organization**](https://github.com/hed-standard) contains the source for code and docs for HED.
- The [**HED schema viewer**](https://www.hedtags.org/hed-schema-browser) allows you to browse HED vocabularies, both released and under development.
- The [**HED resources**](https://www.hedtags.org/hed-resources) has links to all HED documentation.

### Online deployment

The stable version of the HED online tools is available for your use at: [**https://hedtools.org/hed**](https://hedtools.org/hed). An alternate version [**https://hedtools.org/hed_dev**](https://hedtools.org/hed_dev) has the latest features, some of which are experimental.

## Installation

### Local Development Setup

The project uses `pyproject.toml` for dependency management. Install the package with optional dependency groups based on your needs:

**Basic runtime installation** (Flask app + HED tools):

```powershell
pip install -e .
```

**Development installation** (includes code formatting, linting, and testing tools):

```powershell
pip install -e .[dev]
```

**Documentation building**:

```powershell
pip install -e .[docs]
```

**Production deployment** (adds gunicorn for production server):

```powershell
pip install -e .[prod]
```

**Multiple extras** (combine as needed):

```powershell
pip install -e .[dev,docs]
```

### Dependency Groups

- **Base dependencies**: Flask, hedtools, pandas, openpyxl, etc. (required for all installations)
- **`[dev]`**: black, ruff, coverage, codespell, mdformat (for development only)
- **`[prod]`**: gunicorn (for production deployment, not needed for local development)
- **`[docs]`**: sphinx, furo, myst-parser (for building documentation)

**Note**: For local development, you only need `[dev]`. The Flask development server (`python hedweb/runserver.py`) is used instead of gunicorn.

## Testing

**Note**: The following instructions assume you are running in an activated virtual environment.

### Unit Tests

Run the main test suite without requiring external services:

```powershell
# Run all unit tests
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test*.py" -v
```

### Service Tests (Integration Tests)

Service tests validate the REST API endpoints by making HTTP requests to a running HED web server.

**Option 1: Automatic (Recommended)**\
Use the provided script that starts the server, runs tests, and cleans up automatically:

```powershell
# Run service tests with automatic server management
python services_tests/run_service_tests.py
```

**Option 2: Manual Server Management**\
Start the server in one terminal and run tests in another:

Terminal 1 - Start server:

```powershell
# Run the server at http://127.0.0.1:5000
python hedweb/runserver.py
```

Terminal 2 - Run tests:

```powershell
# Run the tests exercising the server
python -m unittest discover services_tests
```
